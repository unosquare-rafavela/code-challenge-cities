# Code challenge: Weather App

_Time limit_: 40 min

## Instructions:

Implement a weather app where users see a table of cities (_cities.json_) with the following information:

- City name
- State
- Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- Humidity
- Conditions

## Requirements:

- The app should save the fetched data to a local state.
- If some data is missing, show "N/A" as a placeholder.
- The app should be able to filter by city name or state.
- The app should allow users to add new records and filter the list of cities by city name or state.
- Each record should have a delete button (delete from the local state).

## JavaScript features to validate:

- Async data fetching: async/await, fetch, error handling
- State management and hooks: useState, useEffect
- Functional components: pure components, props
- Array manipulation: map, filter, reduce
- JSON manipulation: parsing, destructuring

## Plus:

- Unit testing
- Error messages
- React performance optimizations
